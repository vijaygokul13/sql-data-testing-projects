Project Title: 
Advanced Real-World SQL Challenges Using CTEs, Recursion & Analytics

Overview:
This project showcases 24 advanced SQL challenges based on real-world business scenarios â€” covering employee productivity, HR analytics, project management, diversity metrics, performance scoring, and recursive reporting structures.

Every challenge is built around clean SQL logic using Common Table Expressions (CTEs), with a focus on modularity, performance, and clarity.

Skills Demonstrated:
- Modular Query Design using CTEs
- Recursive CTEs for employee hierarchy and department structure
- Composite KPI calculation using normalization
- Salary, bonus, and performance benchmarking
- Multi-level reporting chains (for employees and departments)
- Project allocation analysis and imbalance detection
- Gender diversity, stagnant employees, ghost employee tracking
- Outlier detection using statistical metrics (STDDEV, Deviation)
- Department ranking using DENSE_RANK
- Continuous trends and cumulative hiring metrics
- Managerial effectiveness evaluation
- NULL-safe calculations and ISNULL/COALESCE usage

Key Highlights:
1. Identify underutilized or overloaded employees.
2. Calculate manager effectiveness grades using team metrics.
3. Detect salary growth opportunities for high-performing but underpaid employees.
4. Build full multi-level reporting chains using recursion.
5. Analyze project involvement gaps over time.
6. Rank employees based on normalized composite KPIs.
7. Track gender diversity department-wise.
8. Build department and employee hierarchies dynamically.

Ideal For:
Clients looking for deep SQL solutions in HRTech, Analytics, Enterprise Dashboards, Workforce Management, ETL Development, or Business Intelligence.
