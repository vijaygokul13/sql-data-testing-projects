Project Title: 
SQL Stored Procedures and Functions for Business Reporting & Automation

Overview:
This project demonstrates your ability to design robust and modular SQL logic using stored procedures, scalar functions, and table-valued functions (TVFs). Built on top of a realistic sales and customer dataset, the challenges simulate common reporting, lookup, error-handling, and performance tracking scenarios.

Skills Demonstrated:
- Stored Procedures with input/output parameters
- Conditional business logic with CASE and error handling
- Scalar Functions for loyalty scoring, discount classification, customer tiers
- Table-Valued Functions for filtering, ranking, and regional product analysis
- TRY...CATCH for runtime error handling (division by zero, invalid conversions)
- Nested error logging using custom log tables
- Clean procedure-based automation for reporting and decision support

Key Highlights:
1. Procedures to get customer, product, region summaries using output params.
2. Scalar functions to categorize customers by loyalty and purchase profile.
3. Table-valued functions to filter and return top-N products by sales.
4. Error-safe procedures using TRY...CATCH for division by zero and invalid input.
5. Logging framework to capture and store runtime issues in a custom error table.
6. Simulation of real business scenarios like promotions, loyalty programs, and region-wise performance tracking.

Ideal For:
Clients looking to automate reporting, encapsulate SQL logic into reusable procedures, build dashboards, or implement rule-based analytics in their data pipelines.
