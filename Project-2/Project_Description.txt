Project Title: Subqueries and APPLY Operator - SQL Practice on E-Commerce Sales

Overview:
This project showcases your deep understanding of subqueries, CROSS APPLY/OUTER APPLY, and analytic window functions through a practical and comprehensive e-commerce dataset. 
You explore various product categories and sales patterns across multiple countries and regions using structured SQL challenges.

Skills Demonstrated:
- Correlated and non-correlated subqueries (in SELECT, FROM, and WHERE clauses)
- `CROSS APPLY` and `OUTER APPLY` for row-wise dynamic subquery execution
- Window functions like `RANK`, `ROW_NUMBER`, and `SUM` with and without partitions
- Conditional logic using `CASE`, filtering with `IN`, `EXISTS`, and aggregations
- Joining master and transactional data to derive insights

Key Highlights:
1. Compare subqueries vs joins to evaluate performance and logic clarity.
2. Use APPLY operator to fetch latest/highest sale for each product or region.
3. Track contribution of each product to total global sales.
4. Identify top-selling products per category or region.
5. Dynamic filtering based on aggregate metrics like average sales or sales count.
6. Extend schema design by adding `product_master` and `product_categories` tables.
